    <meta name="description" content="Digikull education is inspired by our ancient education system called Gurukul. Unlike our current education system where the quality education is only accessible to only those who all well off financially, the gurukul education system was open to everyone where the student could join even the best of education institute in the world without paying any upfront fee. We also allow the student to join the Digikull education by paying a very small upfront fee and the rest of the fee is paid in the form of GURU DAKSHINA after getting the job.">
